# Taxi Finder Client 🍏
This is a technical practice to write a single page web application to find taxi.

### About ℹ️

The task is to create a single page Javascript application using React.
The page should feature a map. The map should show markers illustrating
the up-to-date locations of on-demand taxis in the area.
The page should also feature a UI slider, that enables to change the
amount of drivers displayed on the map. The range should be 1-50.
In order to find the location of local Taxi's, will need to contact API,
and get a list of driver locations.
This endpoint will return a list of driver locations, nearby to the location.

### Tech Stack 📚

 - React for Frontend
 - Rebass for UI
 - Leaflet for canvas map
 - Apollo for GraphQL
 - Jest for testing
 
### Note 🌞

Due to CORS issue on the API, it is not able to call API directly from browser client app.
Therefore, a GraphQL server is developed for calling REST API and act as a medium.
In order to start this project, the GraphQL server is required to run first.
Below is the git repository for it
